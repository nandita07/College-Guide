# College-Guide
This project uses OpenGL concepts to create a guide that can take you around PESIT-Bangalore South Campus, helping you find classrooms, teachers' staff rooms, cafeteria or any other area within the campus.

The user is required to give their location and where they want to be taken to. The app, then, leads the user to the destination using a set of directions.
